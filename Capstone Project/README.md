# Nigeria Covid 19 Data Analysis using Python
* This project employs the use of data science & analytics skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights on the effect of Covid 19 in Nigeria.

### Steps and Approaches
* I scraped data from the website of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control that monitors the country's covid 19 situation and releases data on metrics across all the 37 states in the country.
* I also forked the dataset from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) that publishes daily data on confirmed, death and recovered cases across different countries.
* I took out the data for Nigeria from the JHU CSSE dataset and combined them (the daily deaths, confirmed and recovered rows).
* I used the Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index data that shows the vulnerability index computed by considering several factors such as socio-economic status, population density, housing type, transportation, epidemiological, health system etc.
* I used a dataset that provided the real domestic gross product for Nigeria.
* I then began making analysis to show the different relationships between different columns in the different datasets.

### Future work / Improvement plans
* I plan on finding more datasets with more features so I can get deeper insight on the effect of covid 19 in Nigeria.
